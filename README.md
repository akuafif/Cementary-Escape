# Summary

Cemetery Escape is a 2-dimensional side scrolling platform game developed by Year 3 student specializing in games design and programming, at School of xxx, xxx.  


It is a game about the main character, named ‘Barry’, having to escape the wrath of zombies and evil spirits in the cemetery, and reach the exit gate before getting caught. The player will take on the role of Barry, and help him navigate thru different levels of the game to reach the end of the cemetery, which is represented by a gate.  


Escaping and navigating thru the obstacles is not the only objectives the player has to accomplish, as zombies are reincarnated from the ground by the evil spirit to stop you from escaping.  


Getting in contact with the spawned zombies will take damage to your health, so be careful not to be exposed too much!  


The other obstacle the player has to get used to is the limited field of vision, which is also known as the ‘fog of war’. This limits the player’s vision of the map to a small radius around him. This adds to the suspense of the game, as you have to explore the map to navigate your way out, and not to forget the zombies which may suddenly appear in front of you.  


The zombies will chase after you if you get close to their “radar”, else it will just wander around aimlessly.


The player will not be at a disadvantage during the whole journey, as there will be power-ups and collectibles that are strategically located around the levels.


These power-ups may help widen the player’s field of vision for a limited period of time, and also to boost the health if it is running low.

# Backstory of the Cemetery Escape
The main character of the game, ‘Barry’, was texting with his friend on the phone whilst he was driving home, late night after work. It would prove to be a bad idea as it distracts him from the road. Unfortunately, being too engrossed in texting, Barry failed to notice a humanly figure in the middle of the road, and he could not stop in time. The car collided with the figure and a loud thud was heard! Barry blacked out instantly on impact.


The next thing he knows, Barry finds himself in a cemetery, Lim Chu Kang to be exact. He began to wonder where his car was, why he was in a cemetery, and what on earth happened earlier. As his dizzy mind struggled to make any sense out of the situation, he began to wander around and started to run in panic.


What actually happened was Barry had collided with the evil spirit of Lim Chu Kang, and the evil spirit was not happy, and decided to teach Barry a lesson by leaving him in a cemetery and have some evil fun with him.

# Game Space
Located at various parts of Lim Chu Kang Cemetery, haunted by an evil spirit and infested with zombies!


# Goals of the Game
The goal of Cemetery Escape is to reach the checkpoint at every level to progress, and to reach the gate at the final level to successfully escape. But will the player be able to help Barry to do so? Play it to find out. The objective seems straight forward, but everything is easier said than done as the cemetery has evil spirits and zombies that will be more than happy to catch you and make you one of them, or decide to just kill you.

# Game Mechanics
Cemetery Escape is a 2D side scrolling game. The game space takes place at Lim Chu Kang Cemetery, a locally located graveyard. The player of the game moves around horizontally and in the x-axis. 


As the game space takes place at a graveyard, the graphics and audio of the game has to be relevant as well. The background music of the game adds tension and suspense of the game, as well as adding spookiness in the atmosphere. The sound effects used in the game also adds to the atmosphere of the game, such as the grunts and noises made by zombies when they are close to you, and the player giving a heave when he is trying to jump onto platforms.


The graphics used by this game is also relevant to the game theme. Dark background is used to indicate that the escape is taking place at night, and as there is lack of natural light at night, the tile where the player runs on is darkened. Tombstones are also scattered across the cemetery, as that is pretty much obligatory. 


The graphics and audio used certainly adds up to the overall attraction and hook of the game. 

Another game mechanic that certainly adds to the overall attraction is the particle effects. This can be seen on the player, holding a torch that emits a glow of light around it, and the flame of the torch is rendered by using particle effects. So instead of a static image, which will look boring and fake, the particle effect has animations and acts intelligently, as the flame will leave a trail behind while the player is moving, and will remain emitting light when the player is standing still.


The auther has also worked hard to ensure that we try to get as close as possible to a real cemetery despite being limited to 2 dimensional graphics and basic sounds.

The chaser also has particle effect, emitting a misty glow around the figure, to help enhance the feel and spookiness of the evil spirit.


The objective of this game is not only to run horizontally and jumping on obstacles, it also has puzzles integrated in the different levels.  This encourages player to explore different routes of the level, with dead ends located strategically. By no means is this game is going to be easy, but despite that, the programmer has ensured that the difficulty is acceptable and spurs the player to complete the level, instead of quitting the game altogether.


The artificial intelligence used for the non-playable character also make sense, as zombies are known to always be wandering around aimlessly until it spots a prey, and only then will they spring into action and try to chase their prey down.


The zombie will wander around the cemetery, and if the player gets into the zombie’s detection range, be prepared to run! Or else, get eaten up by the zombie and die.


The chaser spawns a few seconds after the level has started to allow the player a head start into the game. The player has to use it to their fullest advantage! As the chaser can go through everything in the cemetery, and has no boundaries at all. 


If the chaser comes in contact with the player for a few seconds, the player will die instantly from the exposure.


Another obstacle the player has to overcome is the rooted zombie hand from the ground. The hand will appear when you least expect it, and if the player comes in contact with the hand, it will immobilize him for 2 seconds.


Power-ups are available, and are strategically scattered around the level. These power-ups boost the player’s chances of completing the level, as they can collect health boosters to boost their health back to a full 100%. Another power-up available is the full range of view. This allows the player to have a full view of the cemetery for a few seconds, to help the player navigate thru the obstacles quicker. 

# Level Design
![level](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/240938506103422976/779703017037103114/unknown.png)
At the start of the game, a player has to go through the tutorial level. This helps player integrate into the game and get use to the controls. The level also tells the player what to avoid and the obstacles that lies ahead. 


Texts and arrows aides the player to navigate and complete the level, and tips and hints are also located throughout the level.


The design of this level is straight forward, with a few simple obstacles like jumping onto platforms and jumping over holes, to keep the player alert and get used to the environment.

### Goals
-	To let the player get used to the controls and overcoming of obstacles.
-	To let the player get the feel of the game.
-	To let the player encounter the enemies first hand and know what to expect as the game progresses.
### Design Considerations
-	Simple and straight forward; minimal obstacles.
-	Simple enough for player to navigate
-	Make sure instructions, tips and hint are clear.
